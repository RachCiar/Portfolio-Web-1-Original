    <p><img src="images/_KBP2657.jpg" alt=""/>Number four of six children, I was born and grew up in Louisville Kentucky and have raised my family in Louisville as well.  Married for 25 years, my husband and I have three daughters.  I spent the majority of my time, while my children were young, at home raising them and working when time permitted.  Now that they are grown, I have the opportunity to pursue my education.</p>
<p>I researched long and hard on what I wanted my career to be and finally settled on Web Design because I enjoy computers, like to code, and love design, color, form, and function.  I like to problem solve and figure out solutions to difficult situations.  To me, Web design is merging several items in which I excel.  I also wanted a career in which I have opportunity to eventually work from home. Someday (down the road), my husband and I plan on traveling and I would like to take my work with me and earn a living while seeing the country.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I like to sing, quilt, knit, hike, eat healthy and spend time with my family.  My husband and I enjoy doing things with our friends and love playing games, especially card games.  But mostly we love to be around people we love and laugh and enjoy each otherâ€™s company. </p>
<p>I am currently a student at Sullivan University.  Studying Web Design and Programing and plan to graduate Spring of 2019.  I have over 15 years of successful work experience in Office Administration, General Management and Service.   I enjoy working in fast-paced, upbeat, positive environments in which I get to use my skills to support others and accomplish challenging goals.  I am looking to work at a supportive company that will allow me to use my skills and grow as a person.</P>
